# Step-by-Step Guide: How to Use Java in Replit.com

Replit.com is a powerful online IDE that allows you to write, run, and share code directly in your browser. Follow these steps to use Java in Replit.

## Step 1: Create a New Repl

1. **Visit Replit:** Open your web browser and go to [Replit.com](https://replit.com).
2. **Log In/Sign Up:** If you don't have an account, sign up for one. If you do, log in.
3. **Start a New Repl:** Click the `+ Create` button on the top left of the dashboard.

## Step 2: Select the Java Template

1. **Choose Template:** In the "Create a new Repl" window, type "Java" in the search bar.
2. **Select Java:** Click on the "Java" template.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Project

1. **Name Your Repl:** Enter a name for your project in the "Title" field.
2. **Create Repl:** Click the `Create Repl` button.

## Step 4: Write Your Java Code

1. **Open the Main Class:** In the Replit IDE, you will see a file named `Main.java` opened by default.
2. **Edit the Code:** Write your Java code in the `Main.java` file. For example, you can start with a simple program:
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
    ```
3. **Save Your Work:** Replit automatically saves your changes, but you can manually save them by clicking `Ctrl + S` or using the save button.

## Step 5: Run Your Java Program

1. **Run the Program:** Click the `Run` button at the top of the screen. This will execute your `Main.java` program.
2. **View Output:** The output of your program will be displayed in the console at the bottom of the screen.

## Step 6: Explore and Share

1. **Explore:** Feel free to explore more features of Replit, such as version control, collaborative coding, and more.
2. **Share Your Repl:** You can share your project by clicking the `Share` button and copying the link to share with others.

## Example Program

Here's an example of a simple Java program that calculates the factorial of a number:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int number = scanner.nextInt();
        int result = factorial(number);
        System.out.println("The factorial of " + number + " is " + result);
    }

    public static int factorial(int n) {
        int facto = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            facto *= i;
        }
        return facto;
    }
}
```

## Running the Example Program

1. **Copy the Program:** Copy the above program into your `Main.java` file.
2. **Run the Program:** Click the `Run` button to execute the program.
3. **Input a Number:** When prompted, enter a number to see its factorial.
